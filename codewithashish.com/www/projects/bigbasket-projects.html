        <p>
            As a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>BigBasket</strong>, I have been instrumental in the
            development and management of key projects that have significantly enhanced the company's operations and user
            experience.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vendor Portal:</strong> This is a multi-role based portal developed using Angular 2+, Node.JS,
                    Express, MSSQL, Firebase, and OAuth. The portal serves as a platform for BigBasket vendors to list their
                    items and manage their orders effectively. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, ensuring
                    seamless interaction between the company and its vendors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grocery Management Microservice: This project involves the development of an Angular-based portal to manage
                    the lifecycle and storage of groceries. The technology stack for this project includes Angular 4+, MSSQL,
                    NoSQL, Java, and Node.JS. The portal is designed to ensure the efficient management of grocery items, from
                    procurement to storage, thereby enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the company.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            These projects have not only honed my technical skills but also provided me with a deep understanding of the
            e-commerce industry, particularly in the grocery segment. They have allowed me to contribute significantly to
            BigBasket's mission of delivering the best quality groceries to its customers.
